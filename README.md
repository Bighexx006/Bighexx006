## Introduction
Restaurant Revenue Prediction focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict restaurant revenue based on various features as location, type, operational year, and other relevant bisiness factors. Using historical data and predictive analytics, this model aim to help restaurant owners and stakeholders make informed financial decisions, optimize operations, and plan for future growth. 

## Research Question
-  What are the key factors that influence restaurant revenue?
- How does the numbers of customers and menu price of a restaurant affect its earning?
- How can revenue prediction help improve strategic decision making in restaurant management??

## Tools Used
## Microsoft Excel
- Power Query for cleaning and transformation
- Pivot Tables for summarizing insights
- Scattered Plot ( x, y)
- Regression and Correlation (Data Analysis Toolpak)
  
  ## Power BI
  - Interactive dashboards
  - Donut/Bar/Clustered Column/Funnel Charts
 
    ## Process
    1. Download dataset from Kaggle
    2. Imported Power Query for cleaning and transformation
    3. Data Cleaning included:
       Text before delimeters
       Empty rows and columns removed
       Menu Price was formatted to Currency
       
## Analysis and Findings

## Question A: What are the key factors that influences restaurant revenue?

- Findings: It shows that the most important factors affecting restaurant revenue are location, restaurant type, years in business, menu prices and marketing spend.
  
## Question B: How does the type and price of a restaurant affects its earning?

- Findigs: Both more customers and higher menu prices can increase revenue. However, very high prices may reduce the number of customers.

## Question C: How can revenue prediction help improve strategic decision making in restaurany management?
